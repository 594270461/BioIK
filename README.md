Description
------------
This project was started as part of my M.Sc. thesis, and later continued as a research associate at the University of Hamburg.
The algorithm solves the inverse kinematics problem on generic kinematic geometries by means of memetic evolutionary computation - combining genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimisation and the L-BFGS-B algorithm for nonlinear gradient-based optimisation. For information, see the graph below.

The research was published at several scientific conferences, including IEEE ROBIO 2016, IEEE CEC 2017 and IEEE IROS 2017.
