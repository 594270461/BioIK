Description
------------
This project was started as part of my M.Sc. thesis, and later continued as a research associate at the University of Hamburg.
The algorithm solves the inverse kinematics problem on generic kinematic geometries by means of memetic evolutionary computation - combining genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimisation and the L-BFGS-B algorithm for nonlinear gradient-based optimisation. For information, see the graph below.

The following pictures demonstrate the performance and scalability of the algorithm in application scenarious on different robot and character geometries.

The research was published at several scientific conferences, including IEEE ROBIO 2016, IEEE CEC 2017 and IEEE IROS 2017, so I would be glad if you reference it in case of using it for academic work.
